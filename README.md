## üìã Available Commands

### `sync` - Sync Spotify Playlists to Rekordbox

Synchronizes Spotify playlists with your Rekordbox collection, creating a mapping between tracks and identifying missing tracks.

**Usage:**

```bash
./venv/bin/python3 src/main.py sync [playlist_id1 playlist_id2 ...]
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Sync all configured playlists
./venv/bin/python3 src/main.py sync

# Sync specific playlists by ID
./venv/bin/python3 src/main.py sync 1UObZqUr1MtbveqsSw6sFP 2ABCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStU

# Sync specific playlists by URL
./venv/bin/python3 src/main.py sync "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1UObZqUr1MtbveqsSw6sFP"
```

**What it does:**

- Fetches tracks from configured Spotify playlists
- Matches tracks with your Rekordbox collection using fuzzy matching
- Creates a track ID mapping database
- Identifies missing tracks and adds them to `missing_tracks.yaml`
- Generates sync reports with detailed statistics

**Configuration:**
The sync command uses playlists defined in `src/constants.py`:

- `SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_PREFIXES`: Playlists starting with these prefixes
- `SPOTIFY_PLAYLISTS`: Specific playlist names to sync

### `search` - Search Rekordbox Collection

Interactive search tool for finding tracks in your Rekordbox collection.

**Usage:**

```bash
./venv/bin/python3 src/main.py search
```

**Features:**

- Search by track title, artist, or Rekordbox ID

4. Updates track databases and removes purchased tracks
5. Generates summary report

### `crawl` - Spotify Playlist Crawler

Advanced tool for crawling Spotify playlists, artists, and labels to create new playlists with recent releases.

**Usage:**

```bash
./venv/bin/python3 src/main.py crawl
```

**Features:**

- Crawls multiple sources: playlists, artists, labels
- Filters tracks by release/added date
- Creates new playlists with template-based naming
- Generates detailed crawl reports
- Supports YAML configuration with job definitions

**Configuration:**
Requires `crawl_config.yaml` file with YAML anchors for ID references:

```yaml
# Define YAML anchors for IDs (required)
_notes:
  playlists:
    liquicity_festival_2025: &playlist_liquicity_festival_2025 '5GH6XFP11JTr9wzwsNESwY'
    fokuz_releases: &playlist_fokuz_releases '2hs6DgCw92aWOWFM935dLY'
  artists:
    koan_sound: &koan_sound 1NCLweIUpq8knzemBwAwoo
    gentlemens_club: &gentlemens_club 58MEqEE2029jp6KTWTt1hO
    telomic: &telomic 2uCrvTUHRA9kuW4IA67oDn
  labels:
    shogun_audio: &shogun_audio 4JDJd4eld2k95Vj7YTe8rU
    hospital_records: &hospital_records 0sklgkoO5JeS7YNhHS5EmH

jobs:
  - name: liquid_weekly
    inputs:
      playlists:
        - *playlist_liquicity_festival_2025 # Reference using YAML anchor
        - *playlist_fokuz_releases
      artists:
        - *koan_sound # Reference using YAML anchor
        - *gentlemens_club
        - *telomic
      labels:
        - *shogun_audio # Reference using YAML anchor
    filters:
      added_between_days: 7 # Look back 7 days
    options:
      deduplicate: true
      max_tracks: 100
    output_playlist:
      name: 'Liquid DnB - Week {week_num} ({date_range_start_short} - {date_range_end_short})'
      description: 'Fresh Liquid DnB tracks from {input_sources} ‚Ä¢ {track_count} tracks'
```

**Important:** All IDs in the `inputs` section must be actual Spotify IDs (22-character alphanumeric strings) or YAML anchor references (using `*anchor_name`). You cannot use arbitrary strings - they must be valid IDs or references to defined anchors.

**Finding Spotify IDs:**

- **Playlist IDs**: Extract from Spotify playlist URLs (e.g., `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX5Vy6DFOcx00` ‚Üí `37i9dQZF1DX5Vy6DFOcx00`)
- **Artist IDs**: Use Spotify's API or third-party tools to find artist IDs
- **Label IDs**: Labels are identified by name, not ID, so use the label name as the ID

**YAML Anchor Best Practices:**

- Use descriptive names for anchors (e.g., `&playlist_liquicity_festival_2025`)
- Group anchors by type in the `_notes` section
- Reference anchors with `*anchor_name` in job inputs
- This allows you to reuse IDs across multiple jobs and keep your config organized

**Template Variables:**
See `TEMPLATE_VARIABLES.md` for complete list of available variables for playlist names and descriptions.

### `extract` - Extract Playlist Data

Extracts artist and label information from Spotify playlists for analysis.

**Usage:**

```bash
./venv/bin/python3 src/main.py extract <playlist_id>
```

**Example:**

```bash
./venv/bin/python3 src/main.py extract 37i9dQZF1DX5Vy6DFOcx00
```

**Features:**

- Analyzes the 200 most recently added tracks
- Extracts unique artists and labels
- Generates YAML output with structured data
- Saves results to `extracted_data_<playlist_id>.yaml`

**Output Format:**

```yaml
artists:
  koan_sound:
    id: '1NCLweIUpq8knzemBwAwoo'
    name: 'Koan Sound'
  gentlemens_club:
    id: '58MEqEE2029jp6KTWTt1hO'
    name: "Gentleman's Club"

labels:
  shogun_audio: 'Shogun Audio'
  hospital_records: 'Hospital Records'
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files

### Required Setup

1. **Spotify API Credentials** (`src/secret_keys.py`)

   ```python
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'your_client_id'
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = 'your_client_secret'
   SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:8888/callback'
   REKORDBOX_DB_KEY = 'your_rekordbox_db_key'
   ```

2. **Rekordbox Database**
   - Locate your Rekordbox database file
   - Extract the database key using the provided tools
   - Update `REKORDBOX_DB_KEY` in `src/secret_keys.py`

### Generated Files

The tool generates several YAML files for data persistence:

- `track_id_db.yaml` - Mapping between Spotify and Rekordbox track IDs
- `track_id_db_overrides.yaml` - Manual overrides for track mappings
- `missing_tracks.yaml` - Tracks not found in Rekordbox collection
- `custom_tracks.yaml` - Custom track configurations for playlists
- `sync_report_*.yaml` - Detailed sync operation reports
- `crawl_report_*.yaml` - Detailed crawl operation reports

### Custom Track Configuration

Use `custom_tracks.yaml` to insert or replace tracks in playlists:

```yaml
custom_tracks:
  spotify:
    '37i9dQZF1DX5Vy6DFOcx00': # Playlist ID
      - rekordbox_id: 12345
        type: insert
        index: 0 # Insert at beginning

      - rekordbox_id: 67890
        type: replace
        target: 11111 # Replace track with ID 11111
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Batch Operations

```bash
# Sync multiple playlists
./venv/bin/python3 src/main.py sync playlist1 playlist2 playlist3

# Extract data from multiple playlists
for playlist in playlist1 playlist2 playlist3; do
  ./venv/bin/python3 src/main.py extract $playlist
done
```

### Integration with Other Tools

```bash
# Search and buy workflow
./venv/bin/python3 src/main.py search  # Find track ID
./venv/bin/python3 src/main.py buy     # Purchase missing tracks
./venv/bin/python3 src/main.py sync    # Sync after purchases
```

### Automated Crawling

```bash
# Set up cron job for weekly crawling
0 9 * * 1 /path/to/venv/bin/python3 /path/to/src/main.py crawl
```

## üìä Data Files

### Track ID Database (`track_id_db.yaml`)

```yaml
content:
  spotify:
    'spotify_track_id_1': 12345 # Rekordbox track ID
    'spotify_track_id_2': 67890
```

### Missing Tracks (`missing_tracks.yaml`)

```yaml
spotify_track_id:
  artist: 'Artist Name'
  title: 'Track Title'
  itunes_url: 'https://music.apple.com/...'
  date_added: '2024-01-15T10:30:00'
  ignored: false
```

## üö® Important Notes

- **Backup your Rekordbox collection** before using this tool
- **Test with small playlists** first to ensure proper operation
- **Review generated reports** to understand what changes were made
- **The tool is designed for personal use** - modify constants and configurations as needed
- **Spotify API rate limits** may affect large operations

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Spotify Authentication Failed**

   - Check your client ID and secret in `src/secret_keys.py`
   - Ensure redirect URI matches your Spotify app settings

2. **Rekordbox Connection Failed**

   - Verify your database key is correct
   - Ensure Rekordbox is not running during sync operations

3. **Missing Tracks Not Found**

   - Use the `search` command to find similar tracks
   - Check track ID overrides in `track_id_db_overrides.yaml`

4. **Crawl Configuration Errors**
   - Validate your `crawl_config.yaml` syntax
   - Check that all referenced IDs exist

### Debug Mode

Add debug logging by modifying the source code or checking generated report files for detailed information about operations.
