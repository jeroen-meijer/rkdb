# RKDB

## My tool for syncing Spotify and Rekordbox collections.

### How to use:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (This project uses `venv` for dependency management).
3. Run the script with `python main.py` with a command: `sync`, `search`, `buy`.
